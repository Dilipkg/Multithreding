    "Advantages:\n",
    "Improved performance: Multithreading can enhance the performance of an application by leveraging the capabilities of modern CPUs with multiple cores. It allows for parallel execution of tasks, enabling efficient utilization of available resources.\n",
    "Responsiveness: By using multithreading, you can keep the user interface of an application responsive while performing intensive computations or long-running operations in the background. This ensures a smooth user experience, as the UI remains interactive and doesn't get blocked.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreaded programming introduces additional complexity, such as handling thread synchronization, race conditions, and shared resource access. Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, are required to ensure thread safety and prevent issues like data corruption or deadlocks.\n",
    "Debugging and testing: Multithreaded programs can be more challenging to debug and test compared to single-threaded applications. Issues related to thread synchronization, race conditions, or deadlocks may arise, making it harder to reproduce and diagnose problems.\n"

    "Q6.\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they hold. In other words, each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread, resulting in a situation where none of the threads can proceed. This can lead to a program freeze or a significant reduction in performance\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome of the program depends on the timing and order of their execution. In other words, the result of the program becomes unpredictable because the threads \"race\" to access and modify shared resources\n"
